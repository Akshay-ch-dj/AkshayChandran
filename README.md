My Portfolio Page: [Visit.](https://akshaychdev.github.io/)

Made with the thought of a functional portfolio with a simple looks and navigation, using one color design approach, made from base without using any libraries,

Started as a learning project for freecodecamp, As it is one of my early project, it follows the desktop first approach, and also even with sass used, the css needs quite a bit of clean up.

* Front design using SASS, CSS grid and flexbox(may be more than needed.)

* Raw javascript(ES6) used for transitions, responsive with fully functional contact form.

## Design Information

* Colors used - **#fff** && **#20aa76**(#2b7/mediumseagreen/hsl(157,68,39)/rgb(32,170,118))
