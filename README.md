My Portfolio Page: [Visit.](https://akshay-ch-dj.github.io/AkshayChandran/)

Made with the thought of a functional portfolio with looks and navigation, as simple as possible, with one color design approach, made from base without using any libraries,

Started as a learning project for freecodecamp, it follows the desktop first approach, and also even with sass used, the css is quite bulkier.

* Front design using SASS, CSS grid and flexbox(quite a bit more than enough.)

* Raw javascript(ES6) used for transitions, responsive with fully functional contact form.
